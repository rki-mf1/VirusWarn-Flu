# Influenza A H3N2 Tables

The tables that are used to rank the mutations were created through literature research.

An overview of the papers they are derived from can be found below. The corresponding papers for every single mutation can be found in the source column of the table.


## MOC - Mutation of Concern

Those are mutations that have been identified previously in the literature as changing the potential of the virus.

## ROI - Region of Interest

Those are important regions of the gene like for example Antigenic sites or Receptor-binding sites.
